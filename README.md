AI-Based Smart Surveillance System

Project Overview

The AI-Based Smart Surveillance System is an advanced monitoring solution designed to enhance security by automatically detecting harmful objects and activities in real-time. Utilizing state-of-the-art object detection models and deep learning techniques, this system is capable of identifying dangerous items such as firearms and alerting security personnel, ensuring swift response and increased safety.

Features

Real-Time Object Detection: Utilizes the YOLOv8 model for accurate and fast identification of various objects, including weapons.
Object Tracking: Integrates Deep SORT to track identified objects across video frames, maintaining a consistent focus on detected threats.
Smart Alerts: Automatically sends alerts to the security team when potentially dangerous objects are detected.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a web-based interface built with Flask, allowing users to monitor camera feeds and manage alert settings.
Scalability: Can be integrated with multiple camera feeds, making it suitable for various environments such as offices, schools, and public places.

Technologies Used

Deep Learning Models: YOLOv8 for object detection and Deep SORT for object tracking.
Web Framework: Flask for building the user interface and managing the backend.
Programming Language: Python for model integration and system logic.
Computer Vision Libraries: OpenCV for handling video streams and image processing.
Alert System: Integrated with email or SMS gateways to send immediate alerts.
